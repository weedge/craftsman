tips: 
The common practice in the industry is to use the sequential write of database such as mysql's insert running record table to ensure local transaction. Here, rmq's transaction message is used to ensure local transaction submission, which is also sequential write, but the throughput in high concurrency scenarios is higher than that of mysql.
